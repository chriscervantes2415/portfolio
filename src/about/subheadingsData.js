          In addition to my academic achievements, I had the privilege of completing a valuable On-the-Job Training (OJT) experience during my college years from  the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT). This experience not only allowed me to apply the knowledge gained in the classroom but also gave me a glimpse into the real-world applications of my field of study.
